            Agile ways of working are quickly becoming a trend and making rounds
            across companies, having now seeped into departments and industry

            >
            Definitely, yes. In fact, it proves to be equally beneficial for
            non-IT teams, since Agile principles and processes can be just as
            efficiently applied to marketing, finance, legal, and a variety of
            other teams and departments within a company. Teams that act in
            support and are often viewed as supplementary to product development
            teams within an organization, can greatly benefit from adopting the
            same principles in work management as their more techy counterparts.

            The perks of adopting Agile as your workplace philosophy is in its
            flexibility and versatile assortment of ideas and concepts. It
            always comes back to making the most of your time and efforts in
            order to work as a team and push for the result. Marketers saw these
            benefits as desirable and so in 2012, an event took place that has
            since been known as Sprint Zero, where marketers came together to
            align their vision of Agile in the context of marketing. They have
            come up with values and principles that were put together in the

            the focus on the goal, and know where you are standing in your
            progress at any given moment. What’s more, it connects the dots
            between all the diverse parts of a team and makes you operate as a
            single mechanism, where one gear connects to the other and
            everything moves in unison.

              >4th Annual State of Agile Marketing Report</a
            >
            published by AgileSherpas, in 2021 as many as 51% of marketers were
            using Agile in their daily work, and out of those over one-half were
            using a hybrid Agile framework rather than strictly sticking to just
            one, Scrum or Kanban. This indicates that Agile has already ‘entered
            the building’ and non-IT teams don’t hesitate to take it as it is
            and adjust Agile basics to the specifics of their line of work.

          <h4>Agile Marketing Genesis: Zero to Hero</h4>
          <p>
            Agile is typically used within software development teams as a way
            to streamline their processes and aim for continuous delivery of
            updates and new features. That’s what it was initially designed for,
            so using it as a way of managing non-IT teams requires a creative
            approach. Having said that, it definitely comes with its benefits
            and is worth giving a try. The Agile approach can introduce a more
            efficient and transparent way of working, boost teamwork, and help
            the team keep their eyes on the goal. Approaching a non-technical
            team with the intention of introducing Agile, you may expect to run
            into issues that will be specific to the team, its composition and
            the practices they have settled in due to the nature of their work
            and interactions within the team or other departments. In fact, one
            may come to a curious realization, as was the case with Cyber Craft
            Solutions Digital Marketing team when they decided to take the leap
            and go Agile:

              and established processes, or more like lack thereof,”

          <h4>Setting Up the Experiment: Initial Steps. Essential Changes</h4>

          <p>
            Case in point, we found ourselves with a Digital Marketing
            cross-functional team that possessed all the skillsets required to
            deliver the final result, <strong>Scrum framework</strong>.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>One-week sprints.</strong> These are the standard practice
              in Agile, so it was the expected way to go. What was important
              though, introducing sprints helped manage the initial existing
              chaos that was coming from the lack of strictly set expectations
              and a limit on just how many “fires” exactly a team can deal with
              realistically. Introducing sprints as a limited chunk of time
              where the team was expected to deliver tangible results helped
              tone down the constant sense of urgency and reset with a focus on
              a realistic goal.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>JIRA Scrum board and backlog</strong> can greatly
              contribute to improving the workflows and setting goals for the
              sprints. Defining the scope of work for the upcoming sprints and
              allocating some time for preparations allowed the team to have a
              wide backlog of tasks ready for pick-up in case any current tasks
              are blocked or extra capacity opens up at any point during the
              sprint.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>All ceremonies except refinement </strong>were introduced
              in the team. Agile ceremonies are necessary for the team to be
              able to follow the principles of this way of working, so the team
              started right off with daily stand-up meetings, sprint demo, and
              planning.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No estimation in the beginning.</strong> A good idea is to
              let the team get familiar with their capabilities, and get a sense
              of their own capacity for the sprint. Eventually, the team will
              understand what they can accomplish within the sprint
              realistically and layer it with the concept of task estimation in
              Agile.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Full-time Scrum Master</strong> took on the role of
              helping the team get on with the new practices, and follow the
              Agile ceremonies.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Early Wins and A-ha Moments</h4>

          <p>
            As the Marketing team settled into the new way of working, it soon
            became evident what works, and what else needs to be introduced or
            changed. These are some of the observations and conclusions that
            helped them navigate the changes successfully:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Stable delivery</strong>, even when PO was absent, was a
              strong argument for the benefits of the ongoing Agile
              transformation. It became evident that Agile can and does work for
              non-IT teams and greatly improves their efficiency and output.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Visibility and constant delivery</strong> for all
              stakeholders is the first and foremost benefit that comes with
              introducing Agile within a team, be it tech or non-tech.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Estimation in story points was added </strong>as the team
              eased into its newly established Agile practices.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data-driven planning</strong> proved to be efficient in
              setting better estimates and planning the scope of work.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Monday-Friday </strong>work span is hard and can result in
              work over the weekend.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Quarterly PI Plannings</strong> have been introduced as
              per the SAFe framework including System Demo and Inspect&amp;Adapt
              sessions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Team growth and other departments</strong> were involved
              in PI plannings, such as Design, Recruitment, People Partners,
              Sales, and SDO. Coming from the nature of marketing work, it was
              necessary to establish a strong collaborative workflow with other
              departments, and show how marketing efforts have a positive impact
              across the company.

            Agile Marketing Level-Up: Do It Harder, Make It Better
          </h3>

          <p>
            After the initial introduction of the Agile way of working and once
            the team got comfortable with it, it soon became apparent that Agile
            can and should be adjusted to meet the immediate needs of the team.
            Setting out on an Agile transformation journey, it was important to
            understand what it can potentially bring ‘to the table’ of a
            non-technical team, and that not all ‘gifts’ will be as readily
            accepted by the team and the established workflow. So, as the
            marketing team got more comfortable with the Scrum processes and
            ceremonies, they started introducing little changes to make it more
            efficient and responsive to the team’s requirements or grievances.

          <h4>Adjusted Sprint Length: Improved Task Completion Rate</h4>

          <p>
            A sprint typically lasts for one to four weeks which is the optimal
            time sufficient for the team to complete and deliver a part of a
            bigger project. Depending on the line of work and overall workload,
            team size and composition, and other factors, it may be beneficial
            to decide on the length of the sprint, longer or shorter, that
            allows the team to have deliverables ready by the end of the
            allocated time period, without being caught off guard with a big
            chunk of an incomplete task at the end of the sprint.
          </p>

          <p><strong>What we did: </strong>Two-week sprints</p>

          <p>
            Agile project management for marketing shows proven efficiency as it
            gives the team a lot of much-needed flexibility in its work. In this
            case, Cyber Craft Solutions marketing team started out working in
            one-week sprints but as the team was growing and expanding its scope
            of work with new projects and milestones, it soon became noticeable
            that short sprints with the ever-growing workload lead to a
            disbalance. It was proving to be increasingly difficult to try and
            keep up with Agile ceremonies and actually get all the work done
            with so much time going to meetings and sync-ups. So, the team
            decided to shift to two-week iterations which allowed for better
            managing of the workload and dependencies, both inside the team and
            with other departments, thus allowing to properly focus on priority
            tasks and improving the overall task completion rate.

          <h4>Agile Meetings for the Win</h4>

          <p>
            The Agile way of working comes with its set of procedures and
            ceremonies that help the teams power through the backlog of tasks,
            be on top of their work, and know the status of the tasks at any
            given time.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>What we did:</strong> Introducing shorter but more focused
            meetings
          </p>

          <p>
            The marketing team decided on making retrospective meetings shorter
            but focusing on at least one enhancement for the next sprint and
            their workflow. Sprint retrospectives are conducted every so often,
            but properly implemented they foster the team to ‘snap back’ to the
            initial goals and objectives set for the team. The team analyzes the
            way they work and understand why they were running into the same
            issues throughout the sprint. Having the layout for the processes
            and seeing where the team is falling short helps brainstorm new ways
            to address the team’s shortcomings. Formulating SMART retrospective
            enhancements is crucial for showcasing the value of this meeting
            both to the Scrum Team and stakeholders.
          </p>

          <p>
            Other improvements were deciding to keep stand-ups short and to the
            point, discuss all dependencies and set goals for the day, so that
            the team members can continue discussing tasks in detail as the day
            goes on and work towards accomplishing common goals.
          </p>

          <h4>Trust the Experts: Getting an Agile Expert on Board</h4>

          <p>
            Agile introduces various frameworks to work with, each having its
            peculiar characteristics. If Kanban can be pretty straightforward
            with minimal requirements for adhering to ceremonies or strict role
            establishment, Scrum is way more structured and depends on efficient
            planning for each iteration. One works great for mature teams, the
            other can be taught to teams of any composition and relation to the
            IT sector. Whatever way you choose to pursue, it’s a good idea to
            invite an
            <a href="/insight/scrum-master-competencies/">Agile expert</a> to help
            you get on board with the new way of working.
          </p>

          <p><strong>What we did</strong>: Scrum activities Power-up</p>

          <p>
            At some point along the way, the marketing team invited an expert
            Agile Coach to work alongside the team Scrum Master and join us for
            standups, sprint demo and planning meetings. The ‘grey cardinal’
            observed the team from the inside and helped us coordinate and
            further improve our Agile processes. Under his guidance, a
            retrospective meeting was conducted where the team agreed on further
            steps to take in improving the way they work. This experience helped
            bring more order into the already established processes, make the
            meetings more efficient, better understand each one’s capacity when
            committing to tasks, and align the work in a way to stop starting
            and instead focus on finishing tasks.
          </p>

          <h4>When the World Goes Remote: Adjust and Evolve</h4>

          <p>
            The two years spent in Covid-19 lockdown weren’t easy on anyone, and
            it was definitely the case for collocated Agile teams who, until
            recently, heavily relied on touch-base and in-person collaboration.
            As the world embraced remote work and fully shifted to WFH, Cyber
            Craft Solutions followed suit and with some experience behind our
            belts nonetheless. Even before the pandemic caught the world in its
            grip, we had successful experience conducting an
            <a
              href="/insight/online-pi-planning-for-distributed-teams/"
              data-type="URL"
              data-id="online-pi-planning-for-distributed-teams.html"
              >online PI planning</a
            >
            for distributed teams. Taking that experience and translating it to
            the realities of the world in lockdown was just a matter of time.
          </p>

          <p><strong>What we did:</strong> Remote PI planning</p>

          <p>
            The marketing team has been working with Scrum for quite some time
            and had established processes with regular PI plannings. However,
            with the onset of the global health crisis, it was no longer a
            feasible option. Remote PI planning has been prepared and held
            instead. The team connected to an online event and used online tools
            as an equivalent to a physical board typically used. The experience
            was deemed an overall success and the new practices have been
            carried on to all the consecutive planning events and meetings. It
            has been a fairly easy transition for the team since they were
            already used to working with many of the tools. The change was in
            making it consistent and a set practice.

            Cyber Craft Solutions has been successfully
            <a href="/service/agile-transformation/">applying Agile</a> for
            non-software teams ever since it first initiated its own Agile
            transformation a few years back. Over the years, it has proven to be
            a driver for results and a way for different departments (e.g.,
            marketing and design, marketing and recruitment, etc.) to
            collaborate and manage dependencies more efficiently.

            What could be better proof than the testimonials of our Digital
            Marketing team specialists and their reflections on working with
            Agile in mind and at heart? For as long as you set your mind to it
            and commit to change, a job done in Agile is a job well done.

              “The Agile mindset is a daily practice that lays out the
              foundation for all processes and tasks that the entire marketing
              team adheres to. Well-thought-through and continuous planning of
              the work ahead allows the luxury to get rid of unnecessary
              meetings and overbearing tasks that get stuck in the making until
              they are made redundant. Although the workload is never ending, a
              wise application of Agile principles and working within the Scrum
              framework creates a stress-free environment for the team with a
              mutual feeling of support and comradery. It’s a “one for all”
              mindset that promotes problem-solving instead of scapegoating.”
