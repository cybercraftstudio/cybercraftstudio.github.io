              What is a Cloud Data Warehouse?&nbsp;
            </h3>
            <p>
              A cloud data warehouse is a system in the public cloud that
              gathers, stores, and manages crucial business data. It’s a
              centralized repository for information collected from various
              disparate systems that entrepreneurs can leverage to gain
              invaluable insights into business processes.

              these systems undergo regular upgrades to facilitate the storage

              fit for SMEs and established brands. Thanks to

              Major Differences Between Cloud Data Warehouses and On-premises

              Since
              <a

              >
              are a mainstream technology and essential for business growth,
              entrepreneurs will often ponder whether to create it on-premises
              or in the cloud.
            </p>

            <p>
              Below we are going to look at their differentiating factors,
              helping you decide which is the best approach.
            </p>

            <p>Let’s delve into the specifics.</p>

            <h4 id="on-premises-data-warehouses">
              On-premises Data Warehouses
            </h4>

            <ul>
              <li>Complete control over the tech stack</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              On-premises data warehouses allow organizations to use their
              desired tech stacks. That means that a company can use software
              applications and hardware of their choice, and give access to
              whoever they deem fit.
            </p>

            <p>
              For instance, if the system suffers downtime, the relevant
              in-house IT specialists will handle the issue quickly and will not
              need the help of third parties as is the case with cloud-based
              systems.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Local speed and performance</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Since on-premises warehouse systems work locally, they rarely
              experience network latency &#8211; even if the server is off-site.
              However, note that impeccable performance (in this case) is not
              always guaranteed.
            </p>

            <p>
              Even with minimal delays in network communication, the company may
              experience subpar system performance as a result of low memory
              mediums, improperly working hardware and misconfigured servers.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Governance and regulatory compliance</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Entrepreneurs who choose on-premises solutions are responsible for
              all or a significantly large portion of the system’s governance
              and regulatory compliance. As such, they will not have any
              problems, for instance, identifying data location which is among
              the GDPR requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
              This also means that these companies will need to single-handedly
              monitor security performance which requires substantial resources
              and can be overwhelming especially for enterprises.
            </p>

              is a result of the ability to grow and shrink data management to
              meet the changing business demands. Such elasticity is vital for
              growing businesses as it allows them to efficiently handle their
              growing workload.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Cost efficiency</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Cloud data warehouses reduce the need for hardware and other
              expenses related to setting up servers &#8211; meaning lower
              initial capital investments. It also has fewer labor and
              maintenance demands, allowing the company to enjoy extensive
              financial savings.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Bundled capabilities such as IAM and analytics</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Security</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Since data security is a top business concern, top cloud data
              warehouse providers leverage tech solutions, and implement
              policies and procedures to protect these systems and their
              associated data. They actively stay true to the core principles of
              information security and governance as well as support regulatory
              compliance to provide best-in-class security.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>System uptime and availability</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              When signing up for cloud services, users expect impressive system
              uptime with minimal network interruptions, and this is what they
              get. Generally, reputable cloud data warehouse providers guarantee
              clients service level agreements of not less than 99.9%
              availability for their services. Meaning, the total hours of
              system downtime in a year should be 9 hours or less.
            </p>

            <p>
              To facilitate reliable services, cloud providers will go a notch
              higher to implement the right tools and resources, as well as
              engage the help of

              Generally, cloud computing leverages IT resources and
              infrastructure that can be expanded or decreased to address
              company needs. And the data warehouse cloud architecture is not
              any different as it will handle increased workloads without
              crashing or experiencing performance issues.
            </p>

            <p>
              The cloud DWH system is also elastic. This means entrepreneurs can
              increase or decrease data storage and management resources in line
              with business demands. And this is done without affecting cloud
              operations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Such elasticity allows the system to seamlessly adapt to the
              organization’s changing workloads throughout the year, boosting
              and lessening resources as needed. Seasonal businesses
              particularly appreciate this feature as they do not pay for the
              unused capacity.

            <p>
              Cloud systems were built for universal accessibility. As long as
              you have an internet connection, you can access data at any time
              and from across the globe.

              <li>And the best thing?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Providers put security protocols in place that allowed only
              authorized persons to access this data. The system maintains data
              integrity even with multiple people working on the same data
              simultaneously.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Integration</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Since data warehouses gather data from various sources, improving
              connectivity between these systems is imperative. Cloud-based data
              warehouse solutions harness the power of modern-day technologies
              and tools to integrate with third-party applications. The
              applications you choose depend on your business needs and existing
              infrastructure.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a result, companies enjoy the flexibility that comes with

            <p>
              Data storage is one of the major challenges companies face as they
              expand business operations. Many companies will need to purchase
              high-tech servers to serve as additional storage, which can be
              expensive.
            </p>

            <p>
              As such, many companies are choosing cloud-based data warehouse
              systems as they offer a variety of remote storage options to suit
              your organization’s storage needs. They are also cheaper compared
              to buying physical storage infrastructure. Furthermore, businesses
              can manage storage capacities, adjusting to their current workload
              which, in turn, ensures long-term savings.

              Cloud DWH platforms outperform their on-premises counterparts in
              that they have better network performance. They can easily process
              large volumes of data without delay and boast impressive system
              uptimes.

              enjoy optimal services with minimal to no lag times.
            </p>

            <p>
              Besides, DWH set up on the cloud offers automatic scaling, a
              feature many enterprises find appealing. During times when
              operations are at peak level, the business can scale as high as it
              can, boosting performance.

              Why Your Company Should Consider Migrating to a Cloud Data
              Warehouse
            </h3>

            <p>
              Switching to cloud data warehouses is a strategic move as it uses
              information that would otherwise be stuck in silos. The company’s
              marketing, finance, sales, and logistics department can then
              leverage information from the different data points to create
              reports and for other analytical purposes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, having a data warehouse in the cloud boosts business
              performance and allows faster data processing, which effectively
              minimizes bottlenecks. Providers also invest in multi-layered
              security protocols that keep information secure. Additionally, it
              is more cost-effective than on-premises solutions and supports
              scalability, whether your data needs dip or rise.
            </p>

            <h3 id="end-note">End Note</h3>
