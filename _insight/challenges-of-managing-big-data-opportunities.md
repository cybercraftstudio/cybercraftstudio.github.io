          <h3 id="what-is-big-data">What is Big Data?</h3>
          <p>
            Simply put, big data refers to voluminous amounts of data that
            increase exponentially with time, hence difficult or nigh impossible
            to process with traditional methods. For this reason, the benefits
            of big data are unrivalled when it comes to generating real-time
            business insights for marketing campaigns,

          <h3 id="5-vs-of-big-data">The 5 Vs of Big Data</h3>
          <p>
            Although big data mimics various characteristics, there are 5
            prevalent traits, dubbed the 5 Vs, that make this concept stand out
            from standard data sets. It is some of these traits, such as volume
            and velocity that create issues in big data. That said, let’s
            explore each trait in detail:
          </p>
          <p><strong>Volume</strong></p>
          <p>
            The concept itself is primarily known as big data, thanks to the
            massive amounts of data volume involved. It is the volume of data
            that classifies a particular set of information as “big data” or
            not. Online businesses started dealing with big data when the number
            of internet users surpassed the

              >1-billion mark</a
            >
            in 2005. To put it into better perspective, experts project that the
            amount of created and replicated data on the internet will likely
            grow beyond

              >180 zettabytes</a
            >
            over the next five years.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Velocity</strong></p>
          <p>
            Velocity translates to the high speed at which big data is collected
            from various sources. For some organizations, focusing on velocity
            gives them a greater competitive edge in terms of real-time
            analytics to understand and meet the prevailing demand. Typically,
            big data should be available at the right time to help organizations
            draw the right business insights from it. Take a time-bound event
            and a food restaurant as an example. Consumer data with regard to
            the event will only be useful during the function. After that, the
            data might not be that important, unless for promoting upcoming
            event sales.

            />
          </figure>
          <p><strong>Variety</strong></p>
          <p>
            The variety trait depicts the heterogeneous nature of big data
            sources, which can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured
            altogether. Regardless of the type of data, their sources can
            emanate from either within the enterprises (in-house systems and
            devices), or external collection points, such as IoT devices and
            social networks. The data source can have varying layers that offer
            different values to the underlying organization. As noted, variety
            can be segmented into:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Structured Data</strong>: This data is organized in
              predefined length, volume, as well as format.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Semi-structured Data</strong>: This data is semi-organized
              and doesn’t conform fully to the predefined formal data format. A
              great example of this type of data includes information on work
              logs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unstructured Data</strong>: This is unorganized data,
              probably collected for the first time. Examples include images,
              texts, and videos.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Veracity</strong></p>
          <p>
            Veracity can loosely be translated to quality. The organization has
            collected voluminous data from multiple sources at high speeds, but
            is it accurate enough to draw insights from? Veracity creates both
            big data opportunities and challenges in many ways. For instance,
            inasmuch as big data is beneficial, too much of it can create
            confusion. At the same time, less amount of data means businesses
            can’t draw full insights from it. Big data veracity can be credited
            to several disparate data types and sources associated with the
            whole concept.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Value</strong></p>
          <p>
            All the above four Vs boil down to the ultimate V of big data, which
            stays on top of the concept&#8217;s pyramid—value. Businesses can
            spend considerable resources at the above stages, but the ultimate
            goal is to draw value, by leveraging insights to offer customers
            what they need, at the right time. That said, businesses should
            convert big data into something that adds value to their operations,
            whether it&#8217;s insights, patterns, or trends.

            tend to center around how businesses can establish and extract value
            from the same. Once that is defined, big data issues can be
            converted into opportunities that businesses can explore for growth
            and greater customer satisfaction. Here is an overview of the
            challenges of utilizing big data in the public sector and how to
            overcome them.
          </p>

          <h4>Insufficient Awareness, Understanding, and Education</h4>

          <p>
            Change is often scary, but inevitable and beneficial along the way
            of its implementation. A good number of organizations cannot benefit
            from the opportunities and challenges presented by big data, simply
            because they don’t understand how the concept works and applies in
            business scenarios. For instance, when employees don’t understand
            data storage and how to use databases, retrieving big data and
            drawing insights from the same will be nigh impossible.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

          <p>
            Organizations should embrace big data conferences and seminars and
            make it the initiative for everyone on their teams to participate.
            Most importantly, big data training should be inculcated in all
            levels of the company, from the bottom to the top, especially in
            departments that regularly deal with data, such as marketing,
            product innovation, and sales.
          </p>

          <h4>Big Data Challenges in Healthcare</h4>

          <p>
            The benefits of big data cannot be overemphasized in the healthcare
            industry. Thanks to real-time analytics from big data, medical
            providers can offer optimum healthcare, expand the in-depth of their
            research, as well as manage chronic conditions, such as cancer
            easily. However, these functions are typically plagued by various
            challenges with big data, such as aggregation and data cleaning,
            given that the medical industry relies on accuracy.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

          <p>
            Healthcare centers and service providers alike should devise better
            methods of aggregating and cleaning patient records from multiple
            sources such as session notes, wearables, and medical history
            databases. For cleaning, service providers should turn to both
            manual and automated processes that follow logic rules to enhance
            quality consistency. They can also leverage medical imaging
            technologies for better aggregation and storage.
          </p>

          <h4>Hiring and Retaining Workers with Big Data Skills</h4>

          <p>
            Leveraging big data analytics on an enterprise scale requires
            various professionals, such as data engineers, data scientists, as
            well as data analysts. However, finding, hiring, and retaining these
            professionals can be challenging due to the growing talent shortage
            in specialist IT roles. At the same time, the readily available
            professionals may demand steep compensation, especially if they are
            going to work on long-term projects.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

          <p>
            Businesses are opting for new recruitment models, such as
            outstaffing and dedicated teams to hire big data professionals,
            without spending significant time and resources. Alternately, some
            organizations are also resorting to custom AI-powered big data
            analytics tools to automate some IT roles that are hard to fill due
            to acute talent shortages.

          <h4>Dealing with Data Integration and Preparation Complexities</h4>

          <p>
            Businesses collect mind-boggling amounts of data every day, which
            extend beyond

              >2.5 quintillion bytes</a
            >. This data is collected from all online and offline sources that
            you can think about, including ERP applications, email systems,
            customer and employee logs, presentations, and even business
            reports. Combining and preparing data from these sources for big
            data applications can be pretty daunting for many businesses.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

          <p>
            These challenges in big data can be addressed by employing various
            data integration and preparation tools, such as:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Centerprise Data Integrator</li>
            <li>IBM InfoSphere</li>
            <li>Microsoft SQL QlikView</li>
            <li>ArcESB</li>
            <li>Informatica PowerCenter</li>
            <li>Cyber Craft Solutions</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Storage and Data Security</h4>

          <p>
            Among the top big data risks and challenges that businesses have to
            deal with, daily include storage and security. The amount of
            information that organizations store in databases and data centers
            is growing exponentially, making them challenging to handle. At the
            same time, businesses that leverage big data insights are growing,
            which translates to rapidly increasing unstructured data sources. A
            data storage solution that is challenging to handle also implicates
            various cybersecurity threats.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

          <p>
            Businesses can turn to modern data handling techniques to
            significantly reduce the size of big data before storage. These
            techniques include compression for reducing the number of bits in a
            data set, deduplication to eliminate duplicates from a knowledge
            set, or even tiering for data storage on multiple tiers. After that,
            an organization can leverage real-time data analytics to reveal
            cybersecurity risks and mitigate them before they manifest.
            Alternatively, businesses can expand their cybersecurity teams to

            Businesses are already using big data to optimize their operations
            and speed up the time to market for their innovative products,
            especially in the healthcare industry. Here are some use cases of
            how Cyber Craft Solutions helps businesses overcome the challenges
            of big data:

            Our client Goat Interactive uses Google Tag Manager for tracking
            data and conversations associated with its third-party affiliate
            partners. However, the growing amount of data in the African sports
            industry called for an upgrade in the client&#8217;s existing
            solutions for web data and analytics. Another challenge was data
            loss or data inaccuracy, thanks to the growing number of multiple
            affiliate parties that complicated tagging in the over 20 GTM
            containers.
          </p>

          <p>
            The experts at Cyber Craft Solutions solved these challenges by
            adopting GTM server-side implementations and successfully migrating
            the entire data within three months. This was followed by GTM
            container configuration and front-end development to enable
            server-side tagging implementation, which increased the client’s
            dimension for measuring performance without compromising user
            experience.
