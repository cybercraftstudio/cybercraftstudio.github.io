            We are observing a surge in DevOps popularity as more businesses
            switch their mindset to that of streamlining development and
            operations, as they wish to enjoy DevOps benefits that come with
            implementing continuous improvement, automation, innovation, etc.

              >2020 DevOps Trends Survey</a
            >
            showed that responders almost unanimously agreed that DevOps has
            positively contributed to their organization. With that in mind,
            it’s easy to see that such a surge in interest is driven by the many
            benefits of following a DevOps approach, so businesses have a
            natural inclination to give their Dev and Ops teams a makeover.
          </p>
          <h3 id="what-is-devops">What is DevOps? What is DevOps culture?</h3>
          <p>
            DevOps can be defined as a workplace culture, prevalent in the
            software development industry, which is characterized by bringing
            together development and operations, having the teams work alongside
            and have a grasp of their entire process from inception to
            maintenance. Such an approach triggers many beneficial changes in
            the team’s way of working and approach to product development and
            delivery, as the focus can be shifted back to the customer and
            generating maximum value. DevOps dismantles silos and fights dated
            practices, which were or still are the norm in some industries
            (e.g., waterfall for healthcare or government projects).

            Why DevOps is important and its main benefits
          </h3>
          <p>
            The benefits of DevOps can be recognized by what it “brings to the
            table” in terms of improving development practices and outcomes, as
            well as how it contributes to your immediate business success. Let’s

          <p>
            These are the benefits that will place you on top of the market
            competition, having a positive impact on your profitability and
            customer satisfaction.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Faster time to market</strong> is made possible with
              DevOps working unanimously on product development and deployment,
              meaning that the actual time it takes to release the product or
              each new update is drastically reduced. Your teams work in shorter
              increments with the main objective to create real and immediate
              value for the client, as opposed to chasing some grandiose vision
              of a large-scale project. You are shifting the focus to
              maintaining a more holistic approach to work processes, where Dev
              and Ops are parts of a whole. Another positive of fast time to
              market is that you can keep up and overrun competition, and stay
              on top of innovations and market trends.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Business metrics monitoring</strong> means that your
              DevOps team is always ready to jump in and fix issues in your
              system or application as they pop out. This is important to keep
              the app running and avoiding downtime which otherwise can be
              harmful as it disrupts the workflow, leads to bad user experience,
              possible loss of data or expected revenue for business.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cost reduction via automation</strong> is an integral part
              of DevOps as you strive to minimize wasteful practices in your
              workflow. Automation helps establish consistent processes, enables
              efficient monitoring, continuous improvement, and immediate
              disaster response.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Increased product stability</strong> is one of the
              benefits of continuous delivery in DevOps. The uninterrupted cycle
              of “build-test-deploy” allows your teams to keep their hand on the
              ‘pulse’ of your product, catch and fix bugs, improve your product
              and deliver updates regularly.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="for-tech-and-innovation">For tech and innovation</h3>

          <p>
            When it comes to improvements on the tech side of things, it’s all
            about how fast you are able to move on once you get into the DevOps
            stream of mind.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Faster software delivery</strong> is made possible by
              working in increments, aligning Dev and Ops parts of software
              development, deployment, and beyond. Your DevOps team is working
              toward the goal of delivering a usable product to the client as
              soon as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Faster bug fixing</strong> comes with the established
              CI/CD practice. With the aim of continuously providing value, when
              you deliver the results of your work to the client, it doesn’t
              mean that you pull to a full stop. DevOps continue improving and
              adding to the product, deploying new features and updates, thus
              creating even more value.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Faster recovery</strong> is an essential part of what
              makes up DevOps. It is possible due to extensive backups and
              having your team always on the ready. With efficient data
              monitoring and established procedures for immediate disaster
              response, your DevOps team can quickly act upon any system
              inconsistencies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Faster features delivery</strong> is again the courtesy of
              CI/CD. Your DevOps team is focused on delivering value to your
              client fast and then adding to it. Any fixes or updates may be
              deployed as often as once a day or every few weeks, depending on
              your established process and how your DevOps team performs.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>
            So, what makes DevOps your winning approach for software delivery?
          </h4>

          <p>
            Where do all these benefits come from exactly? This would be the
            accumulation of practices implemented within your team that stir
            them toward the main goal of delivering value, such as continuously
            integrated operations, CI/CD, consistent communication among
            different teams, automated management of the infrastructure. This
            and more helps assess the level of your

            When SpoedTestCorona partnered up with Cyber Craft Solutions, they
            were looking for a way to quickly release an innovative healthcare
            product that would help provide valuable services to people and
            medical personnel in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis. Cyber Craft
            Solutions set them up with a DevOps team that got right to it. In
            just two business days, the team
            <a

              >set up a development and production infrastructure</a
            >, automate it, and within two weeks they were able to launch a
            cross-platform web application on the market. The extremely tight
            go-to-market deadline was dictated by the rapidly rising cases and
            the need to have a reliable and affordable solution for 15-minute
            testing with results delivered to the user in the app. The DevOps
            team launched the MVP within the set timeframe, and the website
            attracted its first clients in the first few days.

          <h3 id="do-you-need-devops-team-on-your-case">
            Do you need a DevOps team on your case? Why it’s better to have an
            established DevOps team
          </h3>

          <p>
            If you are still asking whether or not a DevOps team is something
            that you need to run a successful business and create unique value
            for your clients, consider some of the following:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>DevOps is a continuous process of improvement.</strong>
              Dev and Ops work in a fine balance that is required to quickly
              release functional software or application and continue adding on
              to it with new features and updates. This requires having an
              established process and a team that works well together and can
              collaborate efficiently with other departments. Once you start
              moving, you can’t trip yourself over because your team is not
              properly aligned and still finding their footing in DevOps.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>DevOps needs to be an established practice.</strong> It’s
              a pretty straightforward model of communication and cooperation
              within the team, where everyone needs to be on board. It’s not the
              case of hiring a person not familiar with DevOps and presenting
              them with the fact that “that’s what we’re doing around here”. It
              requires a certain level of commitment and understanding of the
              DevOps culture.

              <strong>The cost of DevOps experts is rapidly growing.</strong>
              And if you’re reading this, then you can have a good guess why
              &#8211; the demand is high, and experts are few. With the current
              DevOps trends, an expert DevOps engineer is not easy to come by,
              making them a very valuable asset to the team. Because of this,
              trying to build your own DevOps team may not be a viable option.
              That’s why it may be much preferred to opt for DevOps aaS in terms
              of cost and availability.
