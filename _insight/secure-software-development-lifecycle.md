            Today, IT-driven companies face a lot of pressure to modernise their
            applications, automate workflows, migrate to the cloud, and enhance
            customer experience. However, achieving a smooth, successful and
            secure application development remains an immovable milestone for
            many.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, a recent survey suggests that only<a

            >
              36% of businesses</a
            >
            can rate their security testing program at 9 on a scale of 10. And,
            48% don&#8217;t entirely rely on their set secure development
            processes, often they end up including vulnerable codes in
            production.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, businesses can implement the secure software
            development lifecycle (SSDL) policy to mitigate these
            risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            >&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, your product engineers can write various security
            requirements together with functional requirements and perform a
            simultaneous architecture risk analysis during the design phase.
            Alternatively, look at it as a ready-made approach that can be
            implemented at any software development or maintenance stage for
            enhanced security, as well as compliance.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h3><strong>How SDLC Can Be Connected?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
          <p>
            A secure SDLC is what many developers refer to as a “shift-left”
            initiative that entails implementing security checks in a software
            product as early as possible. With this approach, development teams
            can plan deployments efficiently because they can address the
            security risks that might disrupt the planned release timeline
            earlier. While connecting SDLC might seem like rocket science, or
            even expensive, it’s non-negotiable. For a start, you can take
            advantage of automation tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

              recent study</a
            >
            by Wabbi estimates that businesses that adopt a secure SDLC process
            for continuous security can decrease vulnerabilities in their
            software systems by up to 50%. Besides this, there are other various
            benefits of implementing a secure software development lifecycle for
            your business products, including:&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p><strong>Better security</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            A secure SDLC framework ensures that businesses continuously monitor
            their software systems to reveal possible vulnerabilities and
            security lapses. You can then mitigate these risks before they
            actually happen to improve the overall security of the software
            product.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p><strong>Regulatory Compliance</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            Various jurisdictions have laws and regulations that depict how
            software products should operate, to ensure that sensitive data
            doesn’t get into the hands of the wrong people. A sound software
            development security policy ensures that you stay on top of these
            regulatory requirements to avoid fines and penalties in the event of
            a lapse.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p><strong>Reduced Costs</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            Taking a secure application development approach in your business
            allows you to pinpoint flaws at the early development stages. Fixing
            these flaws when developing can be less costly as opposed to
            mitigating them when the application is already deployed.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            Adopting a secure SDLC process in your software products also comes
            with several other side benefits, such as:&nbsp;
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Ongoing training for development teams on secure coding
              culture&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Better in-house security when leveraging customized, internal
              system tools&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Better customer retention due to improved security in your
              software products&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>Consistent security awareness among team members&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>

          </figure>

          <p>
            Although a secure development workflow might differ from one
            organization to another, a typical one consists of the same building
            blocks at different product development stages. To put it into
            better perspective, let&#8217;s look into a typical development
            cycle.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p><strong>Planning &amp; Requirements</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            Defining the application’s concept and its feasibility happens at
            this stage. Besides coming up with a formidable plan for the
            project, you can also write down its requirements, as well as
            allocate human resources at this stage. Most importantly, you should
            conduct basic security awareness training for all employees to
            inculcate a security mindset across the entire team. Typically, this
            stage involves:&nbsp;
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              SDL discovery, which defined the security and compliance goals of
              the software product project at hand&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Security requirements at both technical and regulatory
              levels&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>Security awareness training for all team members&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Architecture and Design</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            You already have the project requirements and insights into the
            skills needed to implement the application design. The next stage
            involves modeling the application&#8217;s design, as well as its
            structure in different consumption scenarios. You can source any
            third-party components that can speed up the overall development
            process at this stage. However, it&#8217;s imperative to
            countercheck any security vulnerabilities in your go-to third-party
            component and make the necessary patches before they weaken the
            entire software product at a later stage.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>The basis of this secure SDLC process includes:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Threat modelling to simulate various attack scenarios and their
              possible countermeasures&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Secure design, where you validate subsequent updates to ensure
              that they are in line with the set security requirements&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Third-party software tracking to seal any security loopholes that
              the bad guys can exploit&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Software programming</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            The actual creation process of the software product happens at this
            stage. For instance, you can write the software product’s code and
            debug it before taking it to actual testing. Secure code development
            practices implemented at this stage include:&nbsp;
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Secure coding, where the talent team can follow an agreed naming
              conventions or checklist to avoid erroneous mistakes that can be
              costly, security-wise&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Static scanning uses code analysis tools to reveal any weakness in
              the code without necessarily running the application&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Code review, which is usually manual to flag any security
              vulnerabilities&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Testing and Bug Fixing</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

            />
          </figure>

          <p>
            You already have a solid code for the application and the design is
            also ready. You can proceed to test it both manually and
            automatically to find any bugs and fix them. Security-proof
            development includes various practices at this stage, such as:&nbsp;
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Dynamic scanning using software tools that simulate hacker attacks
              when running the application&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Following CICD best practices such as continuous integration,
              continuous delivery, and continuous deployment&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Penetration testing using a third-party service provider to iron
              out any issues that your in-house team might have missed&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Release and Continuous Maintenance</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            The application is ready to go live and you can now release it for
            usage in different use cases and environments. New patches and
            versions can also be made available during maintenance. Customers
            may choose to switch to the upgraded versions or maintain the
            original ones. Nonetheless, the recommended SDL practices at this
            stage include:&nbsp;
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Deployment- you can take the continuous integration (CI) or
              continuous delivery (CD) approach to release your application at a
              greater speed and frequency by isolating faults and resolving them
              swiftly. CICD approach also maximizes faster mean time to
              resolution during ongoing maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>Environment management&nbsp;</li>
            <li>
              Incident response plan to give a procedure that your in-house team
              should follow in the event of a security breach&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Ongoing security checks to shield the application from newly
              designed hacks and vulnerabilities&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3><strong>Secure Development Best Practices</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>
            As the name suggests, secure development methodologies prioritize
            security over everything during the overall application development
            process. Prevalent methodologies employed by both established and
            upcoming software product companies include:&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p><strong>Implement an agile approach</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            This development methodology involves building a software product or
            application in small iterations, known as product cycles to enhance
            rapid production and constant revision. Typically, this approach
            prioritizes teams’ interactions over tools and processes and working
            application over endless planning and documentation.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p><strong>Continuous development and improvement</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            This methodology consists of a closed development loop that focuses
            on improving work output throughout the building cycle. The end goal
            of this methodology is to optimize value from ideation to end-user
            application. Numerous steps are involved in the
            <a href="/insight/top-devops-benefits-for-business-efficiency/"
              >DevOps</a
            >
            methodology, including palling, coding, building, testing, release,
            deployment, operation, and monitoring.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p><strong>Well-defined responsibilities</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            This methodology vests the responsibility of IT security on every
            member involved in the application development. Typically, the
            approach entails fostering the organization&#8217;s security
            practices in the DevOps pipeline. The shared responsibility ensures
            that the team builds a security-proof application.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <h3><strong>How to Start with SSDLC</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>
            SSDLC can be beneficial in many ways as described earlier. You can
            get started with this development approach in the following
            stages:&nbsp;
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Review your options for a secure development lifecycle and choose
              the one that works best for your application scenario.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Conduct an architecture risk analysis to close any vulnerabilities
              as recommended by the provisions of the secure development
              methodology.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Extend your research to other projects similar to your methodology
              and learn from action analysis to get it right the first
              time.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>Create a list of coding standards to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>
              Conduct a full training on your in-house team and third-party
              software development partners to increase awareness about possible
              security vulnerabilities&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Leverage various software tools to automate as much of the
              development cycle as possible, such as static code analytics or
              dynamic testing tools to develop a stable build.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Validate processes for security activities within your software
              security initiatives (SSI).&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ul>
