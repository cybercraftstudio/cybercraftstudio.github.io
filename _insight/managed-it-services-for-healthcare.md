            What is Managed IT Services in Healthcare?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Managed IT services in healthcare entails outsourcing a facility’s
            IT functions, as well as operations to a third-party, usually at a
            lower cost than running an internal department. Third-party service
            providers for medical managed services are mostly referred to as
            managed service providers (MSPs).
          </p>

          <p>Healthcare managed IT service providers are responsible for:</p>

          <p><strong>System Monitoring</strong></p>

          <p>
            One of the critical IT functions performed by
            <a
              href="/insight/cloud-managed-services-for-business/"
              data-type="URL"
              data-id="cloud-managed-services-for-business.html"
              >cloud managed services</a
            >
            providers is ongoing system monitoring, which includes testing and
            security checks. For instance, they can manage and monitor your
            medical application and facilitate the necessary upgrades on a need
            basis.
          </p>

            class="wp-block-spacer"
          ></div>

          <p><strong>Technical Support</strong></p>

          <p>
            MSPs give 24/7 technical support to ensure that your medical IT
            infrastructure is up and running, year in, year out. The support may
            extend to regulating identity and access to the platform, doing
            incidences checks, and reporting for real-time resolution before
            they prove to be costly.
          </p>

            class="wp-block-spacer"
          ></div>

          <p><strong>Issue Resolution</strong></p>

          <p>
            Managed IT services come with an all-around service desk to
            facilitate prompt issue resolution. This function can include a
            general IT help desk, a clinical service desk, and a patient service
            desk. Both employees and patients can resort to these help desks to
            have their issues resolved in real-time, 24/7.

          <p>
            <strong>Healthcare &amp; Patient’s Data Backup and Recover</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            This service is sometimes referred to as operational recovery, which
            entails building and storing copies of patient information to
            mitigate losses in anticipation, or in the event of a breach.
            Although healthcare professionals can do this on their own, seeking
            the services of an MSP is always the prudent solution because third
            parties have the technical know-how and expertise of doing this
            effectively.
          </p>

          <p>
            An MSP will build a security-proof strategy that guarantees full
            data recovery in the event of a breach. Even better, they do this
            autonomously so that you can focus on other core practice functions,
            such as following up on patients to enhance their experience and
            promote quality healthcare. The benefits of a proactive data
            recovery plan are numerous, including cost reduction, minimized
            downtime, as well as enhanced cybersecurity.

          <p><strong>EMR Consulting &amp; Support</strong></p>

          <p>
            Electronic medical records, popularly abbreviated as EMR are
            critical in running a modern practice. EMR consulting offered by
            MSPs comes with full-time technical support to minimize downtime in
            case hitches arise. An MSP gives you access to trained and
            authorized professionals who can be stationed at your facility and
            operate as an extended team of your internal department.
            Alternatively, these professionals might travel to your location
            from time to time to ensure that the installed EMR hardware works
            optimally, as designed and intended.
          </p>

          <p>
            Besides installing innovative hardware to streamline workflows when
            capturing medical records EMR consulting &amp; support services can
            extend to configuring:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Tablet PCs</li>
            <li>Printer, scanners, and fax machines</li>
            <li>A signature pad for electronic signing</li>
          </ul>

          <div
            style="height:10px"
            aria-hidden="true"
            class="wp-block-spacer"
          ></div>

          <p><strong>Healthcare IT Security</strong></p>

          <p>
            Cloud security in healthcare can be challenging, given that medical
            practices are regulated by varying rules and provisions that differ
            from one jurisdiction to another. For instance, the laws guiding the
            access and storage of medical data in the US are definitely
            different from the UK’s provisions. With this in mind, healthcare
            professionals often opt for on-premise data storage solutions to
            comply with the local laws and regulations.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, building a custom on-premise IT infrastructure that is
            fully regulatory compliant when accessing and storing patient
            information can be pretty daunting. MSPs can help you do that
            effectively while keeping up with regulatory obligations. At the
            same time, MSPs can help you build applications that require higher
            availability than their regular counterparts to guarantee a secure,
            continuous workflow.

          <p><strong>24/7 Network Monitoring</strong></p>

          <p>
            Often designated as 24x7x365, this is a network monitoring service
            that keeps tabs on your IT infrastructure around the clock,
            throughout the year. The service, usually offered by a resourceful
            MSP, extends to server monitoring and real-time desktop support so
            that issues can be resolved as they arise to ensure business
            continuity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Healthcare practices are investing in this service to cushion
            themselves against unforeseen, but usually targeted and coordinated
            cyberattacks, ransomware threats, and data breaches. Typically,
            network practitioners need 24/7 network monitoring to facilitate:

              >migrating to the cloud</a
            >
            is totally different from what medical practitioners are used to
            when deploying patient information to legacy systems. It takes an
            experienced MSP with necessary data migration &amp; cloud
            infrastructure skills, as well as understanding to do this
            effectively.
          </p>

          <p>
            A reputable MSP will perform various functions when shifting your IT
            functions to cloud infrastructure, including:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Patient data transfer from legacy systems to the cloud</li>
            <li>Data restructuring for PHI encryption and separation</li>
            <li>
              Systems and apps restructuring to ensure that they are
              cloud-native
            </li>
            <li>Security beef-up through network isolation controls</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Data migration to the cloud is an iterative cycle that involves
            moving data of every application from a primary origin to a
            centralized cloud destination. Your MSP will leverage machine
            learning tools to minimize any error or data discrepancies during
            the entire process.

            The Benefits of Managed Services for Healthcare Providers
          </h3>

          <p>
            Managed services for healthcare providers come with a ton of
            business benefits, including:
          </p>

          <div
            style="height:10px"
            aria-hidden="true"
            class="wp-block-spacer"
          ></div>

          <p><strong>Improved Patient Healthcare</strong></p>

          <p>
            Outdated technologies and computer systems are a pain point for any
            business that wants to streamline its operations and enhance
            customer experience, healthcare facilities notwithstanding.
            Moreover, using outdated technologies to manage patient journeys can
            compromise the quality of healthcare, given that they are
            unreliable, and in most cases, insecure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Healthcare managed IT services ensure that your practice leverages
            up-to-date systems and technology to optimize internal processes and
            improve patient healthcare in the process. For example, real-time
            collaborative tools offered by MSPs can increase engagement between
            staff and patients, even in the instances of remote healthcare
            provision.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the same time, managed services can help you increase staff
            mobility, which in turn offers greater employee satisfaction. A
            happy staff means optimal service delivery throughout all patient
            touch points.
          </p>

          <div
            style="height:10px"
            aria-hidden="true"
            class="wp-block-spacer"
          ></div>

          <p><strong>Security</strong></p>

          <p>
            Security is paramount in healthcare facilities because they often
            deal with sensitive patient data. Healthcare businesses are
            typically required to comply with certain rules and regulations to
            guarantee the privacy, as well as security of patient health data.
            For instance, practitioners in the US must comply with various
            federal regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and
            Accountability Act (HIPAA), and the Privacy Rule.
          </p>

          <p>
            The latter regulation requires healthcare practitioners to safeguard
            patient data, whether stored in physical or electronic formats.
            There is also the security law that applies to patient data stored
            in digital formats. MSPs will help you create unique data encryption
            processes, as well as implement innovative IT security measures to
            enhance compliance in these areas.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the same time, an MSP will offer secure collaboration systems to
            ensure that hospital staff works together in real-time without
            jeopardizing the security of patient data. For instance, they can
            encrypt communication between devices, as well as cloud access to
            ensure that all patient records are safe.
          </p>

          <div
            style="height:10px"
            aria-hidden="true"
            class="wp-block-spacer"
          ></div>

          <p><strong>Cost-Optimization</strong></p>

          <p>
            Any business must always keep its operation costs lower to sustain
            itself, healthcare centers not being an exemption. With that in
            mind, it is always the goal of any healthcare service provider to
            accomplish more on a reasonable budget. But again, doctors and
            nurses are expected to offer the highest quality of healthcare
            services as provided by codes of conduct and various regulatory
            requirements.
          </p>

          <p>
            MSPs take over IT management and monitoring functions to help you
            save costs. They can do this at a relatively affordable budget,
            thanks to economies of scale, since they serve many clients at the
            same time. Even better, they offer all-around services, such as
            compliance and security predetermined overhead costs, so that you
            can plan the budget ahead.
          </p>

          <p>
            Managed IT services also means you don’t have to hire specialized
            talents or train the existing internal department on an ongoing
            basis, saving you from unnecessary costs.
          </p>

          <h3 id="scalable-infrastructure">Scalable Infrastructure</h3>

          <p>
            Probably the biggest challenge that healthcare businesses face is
            scalability. For instance, you might have to deal with outdated
            on-premise data centers, not to mention limited physical space if
            you are still using legacy systems for data storage. There is also
            the issue of limited budgets when it comes to technologies that
            offer limited to zero scalable options. All these obstacles might
            hinder business growth and impede patient care improvement.
          </p>

          <p>
            Partnering with an innovative MSP can help you scale rapidly at
            relatively affordable costs. Your service provider can help you
            acquire or build custom software to extend your healthcare
            operations to a cloud-hosted infrastructure. This means that you can
            hire and train more staff, as well as accommodate a high number of
            patients on your system.
          </p>

          <div
            style="height:10px"

              >Business agility</a

            entails rapid, ongoing, and systematic adaption to the prevailing
            industry trends in a bid to maintain a competitive edge over other
            players. This extends to streamlining strategies that touch on
            complex and ambiguous, yet critical functions, such as IT
            operations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Working with an MSP ensures that your medical practice adopts
            strategies geared towards business continuity. For example,
            proactive data recovery plans can ensure that you don’t lose vital
            patient information in the event of a disaster. There are also
            proactive security measures that ensure 24/7 compliance so that you
            don’t get bogged down with unnecessary fines or long-term penalties
            that might include withdrawal of your practice certificate.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another MSP function that can help streamline business agility is
            staffing. An experienced MSP should offer a single point of contact
            for all your staffing functions, including real-time customer
            support, account management, or any other role that you want to
            outsource.

            IT Risks for Healthcare Providers and How to Overcome Them
          </h3>

          <p>
            Prevalent risks faced by healthcare providers due to poorly manages
            IT functions and infrastructure include cyberattacks. A recent
            survey shows that
            <a
              href="https://medcitynews.com/2017/12/physicians-cyberattack/"
              data-type="URL"
              data-id="https://medcitynews.com/2017/12/physicians-cyberattack/"
              >83% of physician</a
            >
            practices have already experienced some form of cyberattack. These
            attacks have led to a loss of vital data, including private patient
            information, lab results, diagnoses, and critical medication lists.
            The survey also points out that phishing and computer viruses are
            the most prevalent types of targeted cyberattacks meted out on
            physician practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            The healthcare industry still remains one of the most sought-after
            targets by cybercriminals, given that most practices around this
            sector still operate on outdated technologies and legacy systems.
            Most practices are often driven out of business if they can&#8217;t
            honor demands from the cyber attackers, such as paying ransom to
            recover their lost data.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fortunately, partnering with an MSP can help you leverage the latest
            technologies that auto-update to safeguard vital patient data. An
            experienced service provider can also implement monitoring systems
            that detect and counteract cybersecurity risks before they result in
            actual breaches.
