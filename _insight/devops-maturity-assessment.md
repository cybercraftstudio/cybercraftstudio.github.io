            DevOps is the product-oriented approach to software development and
            support that is the current ‘it’ of the industry as it shows high
            change management effectiveness and perpetuates the culture of
            constant learning and improvement. Dev and Ops should strive to work
            as a single organism with a maximized effort and all processes aimed
            at a common goal &#8211; continuously delivering value.

            stuck somewhere in the middle of their DevOps evolution. This shows
            just how many organizations still have a way to go in reaching the
            full potential of their DevOps maturity. Still, they get to enjoy
            the benefits that come along the way:

            <li>easier adaptability to changes,</li>

            so far. And that’s where DevOps maturity model comes into play.

          <h3 id="devops-maturity-model">DevOps maturity model</h3>
          <p>
            DevOps maturity model determines how far along you are in your
            DevOps implementation and lets you map out your further route to
            perpetuate growth. Essentially, it should tell you how mature your
            processes are right now, what needs improvement, and how you can get
            to the next checkpoint in your DevOps maturity journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            DevOps requires a continuous effort on the part of your team, and
            you have to understand that this is an ongoing process without a set
            end-point. An organization can’t just implement it as a one-time
            action and be done with it. What’s important to understand is that
            you are setting out on an adventure with your priorities set to
            delivering value and progressing over time in your processes and
            output. Therefore, you will want to eventually assess your
            organization’s DevOps maturity to determine what are your successes,
            what pitfalls and setbacks you should be aware of, what issues may
            pop up further along the way, and how you can prepare for them right
            now.
          </p>
          <p>
            DevOps is all about embracing that philosophy and changing your
            mindset to one of continuous growth and evolution of your processes.
            Understanding your DevOps maturity helps estimate where you are
            standing and adjust for the future challenges and successes.

          <p>
            How to know if you have successfully taken down the barrier between
            development and operations? Has your company established mature
            DevOps processes or are you still struggling to get it off the
            ground? Knowing the level of your organization’s DevOps maturity is
            a necessary step in the process that you will have to take. Every
            organization will eventually find itself at a point where it needs
            to determine where it’s standing and how to proceed. DevOps maturity
            is more about getting the right tools. It starts with adopting a
            culture of continuous change and striving for excellence.

            So, how mature is your DevOps team? These are the general cues to

            Since you already have an idea of what maturity stands for when it
            comes to establishing and running DevOps processes, let’s talk about
            what to look at exactly in terms of processes and procedures, if you
            need to know where you are standing with your DevOps maturity.

            <strong>Automation (CI/CD).</strong> To what extent have you
            embraced automation in your testing, build and deployment
            operations? Automating the routine tasks allows for optimizing all
            your processes and minimizing the risk of human error. This helps
            your team be more efficient and direct their time and efforts
            towards more complex tasks. Automation is what helps establish a
            culture of continuous integration (CI) and delivery (CD) and

            <strong>Documentation</strong>. Are you consistent with your

            and contribute?

            <strong>Disaster recovery.</strong> How ready is your DevOps team,
            really? What is your established process of disaster recovery and
            how prepared are your Devs to act upon any signs of system
            inconsistencies? Do they have an efficient and up-to-date disaster
            recovery plan? How fast can they apply it in case an incident
            occurs? Another important point you may want to address is
            redundancy planning or having all your system components duplicated
            for easy recovery in case of system failure.

            <strong>Business metrics monitoring.</strong> Another one of those
            checkpoints that can never be overlooked in DevOps is keeping track
            of your business metrics and immediately responding to issues just
            as they occur. After all, the sooner you investigate and get it
            fixed, the better it is for business continuity and providing

            <strong>Security</strong>. How secure is your software development

            easy to swerve off the tracks and leave gaps in your security.
            DevOps is meant to prevent that with one of its main objectives

            of software development.<a

            Sufficient DevOps maturity will allow a company to gain momentum to

            DevOps should be considered separately as its own entity, so you
            don’t necessarily need to set up your own in-house team in order to
            benefit from what they can bring to the table. In fact, many would
            argue that it’s more convenient and hassle-free if you set yourself
            up with a DevOps managed services team and have them manage your
            infrastructure. In the long run, you want to have a solid process
            going for continuous value delivery and know that your DevOps is up
            to standard compared with what your competitors have to brag about.
            Where upskilling, team education and consultancy are handled by your
            service provider.
