            and protocols used to move data from one storage system to another
            one, usually for further storage or handling. Data pipeline
            technology combines data from multiple sources by capturing and
            transferring it into another tool, app, or database for more
            seamless access by collaborating teams.

          <p>
            A data pipeline is one of the fundamentals of data engineering
            concepts. It takes an experienced data engineer, well versed with
            programming skills and technologies to build a data pipeline that

            <strong>ETL Data Pipeline Steps</strong>
          </h3>

          <p>
            ETL is the most prevalent and sought-after data pipeline
            architecture by businesses dealing with a custom-built enterprise
            data warehouse or data mart. A typical data architecture gives a
            detailed and exact description of components arrangement that
            enables real-time raw data extraction, processing, and information
            delivery.
          </p>

          <p>That said, here are the steps of the ETL data pipeline:</p>

          <p><strong>Extracting Data</strong></p>

          <p>
            This is the first step of an ETL data pipeline, where raw data is
            retrieved from multiple incoming channels, such as social media and
            business websites. Data engineers usually program codes to run
            scheduled data extraction cycles for specific periods.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Transforming Data</strong></p>

          <p>
            This step involves modifying raw and inconsistent data extracted at
            the first stage of the ETL data pipeline. Data engineers usually
            transform the data and segregate it in different formats, sizes, or
            even colors for optimal querying and analysis. Typically, this stage
            ensures that the collected data is easily usable and discoverable.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Loading Data</strong></p>

          <p>
            Data extraction and transformation are followed by loading the
            usable data into various destinations, such as a data warehouse.
            Some data engineers prefer using Hadoop or a relational database
            management system (RDBMS).
          </p>

          <p>
            A complete ETL data pipeline process can be followed by storage in
            another system, where key organization leaders can access the same
            for business intelligence analysis, report generation, and visual
            creations.
          </p>

            <strong>Data Pipeline Challenges</strong>
          </h3>

          <p>
            Data pipelines are beneficial to businesses in many ways, especially
            when it comes to real-time and predictive analytics. However,
            building a custom or standard data pipeline can be pretty daunting,
            especially for first-time organizations. Here are the five prevalent
            data pipeline challenges:
          </p>

          <p><strong>Data Placement</strong></p>

          <p>
            Businesses need to store their data in the right format and in the
            right location to enhance seamless access, as well as usability.
            Making the right decision can be challenging, given that businesses
            must use multiple tools and connect them to numerous data stores and
            formats, especially if they are going to harness the full power of
            big data.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Data Hosting</strong></p>

          <p>
            Data hosting can either be done in the cloud or on-premise. Choosing
            the right hosting service can be challenging, especially if you have
            to modify the data into a specific format. Thatâ€™s why some
            organizations choose to self-host their servers, but this option
            also comes with operating system, latency requirements, as well as
            memory and disk challenges.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Data Scaling</strong></p>

          <p>
            Data scaling can be challenging, given that modern businesses handle
            up to
            <a

              rel="noreferrer noopener"
              >2.5 quintillion bytes </a
            >of data generated by consumers every day. At the same time, the
            number of data sources, whether sensors or IoT devices, may increase
            unexpectedly. With this in mind, organizations should have data
            storage options that are automatically scalable.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, data scaling issues are more challenging among
            organizations that use on-premise storage solutions. For instance,
            overwhelming data velocity and volume sharding and replication
            create more space for incoming data. In the long haul, these
            processes can prove costly in terms of operations because a single
            technical hitch can mean hours of troubleshooting the whole system.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Data Flexibility</strong></p>

          <p>
            A whole data pipeline system relies on the entire ETL
            (Extract-Transform-Load) process. Although this process is often
            meticulous, a single hitch in one step can cause hours of downtime,
            something that can affect data quality. The situation even gets
            trickier if a business deals with dynamic data sources and events,
            which might mean setting up schemas for real-time data analytics. At
            the same time, an ETL data pipeline that is used for data analytics
            must be optimally elastic for compatibility with various data types
            and schemas.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Data Migration</strong></p>

          <p>
            Data migration techniques depend on how an organization uses its
            data. However, most businesses choose to migrate their data during
            off-peak periods, such as at night, so as to minimize unnecessary
            downtime. Although this might sound convenient, it gets challenging
            when it comes to real-time analytics, as the migrated data will be
            from the previous day.
          </p>

          <h4 id="data-warehouse-definition">
            <strong>2.Data Warehouse Definition</strong>
          </h4>

          <p>
            A data warehouse is a central repository, usually, a relational
            database, modified and optimized to support data reading,
            aggregation, and querying. Although traditional data warehouses only
            supported structured data formatted in tables, modern applications
            can support both structured and unstructured data formats.
            Unstructured data in this case include information formatted and
            presented as images, PDF files, or even audio files.
          </p>

          <p>
            Data warehouse concepts as a single point of truth and information
            in an organization. As opposed to retrieving data from multiple
            storage, data warehousing allows business analysts to report similar
            results and create near-accurate metrics for predictive analytics.
          </p>

          <h3 id="data-warehouse-architecture">Data Warehouse Architecture</h3>

          <p>
            A typical data warehouse architecture includes three basic
            components:
          </p>

          <p><strong>Data Warehouse Storage</strong></p>

          <p>
            A central repository or a database is the bloodline of a custom or
            standard data warehouse architect, as all business data is stored
            where. Business leaders and other employees can then access the data
            warehouse storage to draw valuable insights from its contents.
            Businesses have the option of either an on-premise or cloud-based
            data warehouse storage.
          </p>

          <p>
            The former option is ideal for organizations that want to process
            their data at high querying speeds and uncompromised security. On
            the other hand, cloud-based data warehouses support automatic
            scalability and any data structure. They are also relatively
            affordable than their on-premise counterparts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some data architects might also help you build collective storage
            options that run parallel as a centralized warehouse. This approach
            is usually ideal when enhancing scalability.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Metadata</strong></p>

          <p>
            Metadata contains the information and guidelines for changing and
            processing data when loading it into a warehouse environment.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Access Tools</strong></p>

          <p>
            These are tools that are integrated into the warehouse architecture
            to facilitate access, as well as interactions of the stored data
            with end-users. These tools might include querying, reporting, or
            data mining tools, based on the model of the data warehouse model.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Management Tools</strong></p>

          <p>
            Data warehouse tools help businesses perform automated
            administrative duties.
          </p>

          <h4 id="data-marts"><strong>3.Data Marts</strong></h4>

          <p>
            Data marts are smaller warehouses, usually employed by big
            organizations using enterprise-scale warehouses. Data marts come in
            handy when an organization wants to segment its data. For instance,
            marketing and sales data can be stored in different data marts to
            enhance easy access by the relevant departments.
          </p>

          <p>Data marts exist in three prevalent types, including:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Hybrid data marts</li>
            <li>Independent data marts</li>
            <li>Dependent data marts</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 id="olap-and-olap-cubes">
            <strong>4.OLAP and OLAP Cubes</strong>
          </h4>

          <p>
            OLAP is a simple abbreviation for Online Analytical Processing. This
            computational program allows business analysts and data engineers to
            take a multidimensional approach to data analysis. In other words,
            this tech helps organizations vast data from different angles, as
            opposed to OLTP.
          </p>

          <p>
            OLAP cubes are the multidimensional structures that represent data.
            However, unlike traditional database representation (usually in rows
            and columns), which can be generated automatically, OLAP cubes must
            be custom-built for individual reporting and analytical querying.
          </p>

          <h4 id="big-data-concepts"><strong>5.Big Data Concepts</strong></h4>

          <p>
            Big data engineering concepts are built around the four Vs,
            including volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. The architecture
            used in big data applications varies accordingly with the amount of
            data involved. Organizations that employ big data technology usually
            use a data lake to power the infrastructure, instead of a
            traditional data warehouse.
          </p>

          <p>Prevalent big data concepts include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Data Lake</li>
            <li>Hadoop</li>
            <li>Enterprise Data Hub</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 id="data-architecture-as-a-service">
            <strong>6.Data Architecture as a Service</strong>
          </h4>

          <p>
            Data architecture-as-a-service is an approach taken by business data
            users to circumvent data bottlenecks by building local repositories.
            Typically, the process doesnâ€™t sacrifice enterprise data integrity
            or consistency. This service can exist as an extension model or a
            self-service data engineering approach.
          </p>

          <p><strong>The Takeaway</strong></p>

          <p>
            In todayâ€™s data-driven world, we are all surrounded by data in every
            aspect of life. To keep up and stay ahead of the curve, itâ€™s

                      Data engineers can build a custom data warehouse for your
                      business, as well as data marts if necessary, especially,
                      when it comes to scalable analytics. Data engineers can
                      also write code algorithms to automate data migration and
                      compliance. For more insight on data engineering best
                      practices, check out our recent blog
