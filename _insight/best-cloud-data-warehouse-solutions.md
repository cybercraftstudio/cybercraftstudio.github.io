            Data warehouse cloud solutions are a central repository for all the
            data that an organization collects, processes, and analyzes. The key
            features of data warehouse applications include the ability to store
            multiple types of data in one place and the ability to create
            customised analytics or visualisation based on the stored
            data.&nbsp;

            Cloud vs Data Warehouse Platforms&nbsp;
          </h3>
          <p>
            On-premise data warehouse platforms are still a very popular choice
            for many organizations. They allow you to keep your data in-house,
            and protected from external threats, and you can integrate new tools
            as they become available.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, cloud-based data warehouse services are
            convenient, and scalable, provide access to a wider range of
            resources and are often more cost-effective than on-premise data
            warehouses.&nbsp;&nbsp;
