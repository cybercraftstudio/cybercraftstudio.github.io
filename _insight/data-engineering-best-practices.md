            Data is key when it comes to making informed decisions for
            businesses. It helps businesses get the answers to some of the most
            burning questions about their customers, how much it costs to
            acquire a new customer, or how to improve their products or
            services. Furthermore, the amount of data produced today is growing
            exponentially. In fact, 90% of data existing today has been created
            over the last two years.
          </p>
          <p>
            As businesses tend to rely more on the data they have at their
            fingertips, the role of data engineering is becoming quite
            prominent.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this article, we will go over data engineering best practices
            that are worth considering today. But let’s start from the top.
          </p>
          <h3 id="what-is-data-engineering-some-and-its-main-components">
            What is data engineering and some of its main components
          </h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Data engineering</strong> is the process of making sense of
            large amounts of data. It collects raw data from various sources and
            transforms it to make it accessible and usable to data scientists
            and other end users within the organization.

          <p>
            Without this structuring, the large amounts of data that companies
            have on their hands are essentially useless as they can’t be used to
            drive any conclusions or affect any decisions. Data engineering
            provides valuable insights into available data that can make a
            substantial impact on a company’s growth, predict future trends, or
            understand network interactions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Data engineering considers the end-to-end process as
            <strong>data pipelines</strong> that transform and transport data to
            present it in a form that can be analyzed and used to drive some
            insights. The pipelines take data from one or various sources and
            collect them in a single warehouse to consolidate one single source
            of truth.
          </p>

          <p>The common elements of the data pipeline are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Source(s)</strong> &#8211; one or various sources that
              data comes from, such as database management systems (e.g.,
              MySQL), CRMs (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot), ERPs, some SM management
              tools, or even IoT devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Processing steps</strong> – this involves extracting data
              from the sources, transforming and manipulating it following
              business needs, and then depositing it at its destination
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Destination</strong> – is typically a data warehouse or
              data lake, a place where data arrives after being processed
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Building a data-first company starts with organizing the data you
            have and its various sources. Data engineers here play a strategic
            role, having the capability to harness the full potential of data
            and how it affects the entire organization. When it comes to making
            the most of your data, there are some data engineering best
            practices to follow:

            10 data engineering best practices
          </h3>

          <h4 id="make-use-of-functional-programming">
            Make use of functional programming
          </h4>

          <p>
            Functional programming is a perfect choice when working with data.
            ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is known to be quite challenging,
            often time-consuming, and on top of that hard to operate, advance,
            and troubleshoot. Applying a functional programming paradigm brings
            a lot of clarity to the process which when it comes to large volumes
            of data is essential. Additionally, it enables creating a code that
            can be reused across multiple data engineering tasks.
          </p>

          <h4 id="practice-modularity">Practice modularity</h4>

          <p>
            Building a data processing flow in small, modular steps is another
            best practice in data quality and quality engineering. Modularity
            means that each step of the process is focused on a specific problem
            which makes code easier to read, reuse and test. Modules can also be
            easily adapted independently which comes especially in handy as the
            project grows. Modules that are built with a set of inputs and
            outputs that are suitable for numerous contexts will make data
            pipelines clean and also easy to understand from the outside and
            thus they can be easily reused in the future.
          </p>

          <h4 id="follow-proper-naming-convention-and-proper-documentation">
            Follow proper naming convention and proper documentation
          </h4>

          <p>
            To help a team be on the same page and collaborate more effectively,
            it’s a good data engineering principle to practice proper naming
            conventions and documentation. This is especially useful when the
            actual owner is not available to make changes or modifications. Make
            it a rule inside the team to provide proper explanatory descriptions
            of pipelines, jobs, and components as well as provide use cases it
            might solve.
          </p>

          <p>
            When it comes to naming, strive to name the objects in a way that
            makes it clear to a new person that might join the team and avoid
            confusing abbreviations. As for creating useful documentation, it
            should focus on explaining the intent behind what the code is doing
            rather than stating the obvious.
          </p>

          <h4 id="select-the-right-tool-for-data-wrangling">
            Select the right tool for data wrangling
          </h4>

          <p>
            With the large amounts of data and data sources that keep growing,
            it’s extremely important to keep the data clean and organized for
            easy access and analysis. A data wrangling tool can tackle any
            inconsistencies in data and transform distinct entities, for
            instance, fields, rows, or data values within a data set and make
            them easier to use. The clean is the data you feed, the data and
            more accurate insights you can expect. Data wrangling tools can help
            detect, drop and correct records prepared for the data engineering
            pipeline.
          </p>

          <h4 id="strive-for-easy-to-maintain-code">
            Strive for easy to maintain code
          </h4>

          <p>
            Being clear and concise are the principles that also apply when it
            comes to writing code. Making it readable and easy to follow is a
            good practice that will help everyone on the team to work with it in
            the future. Some of the best code development principles to follow
            here are:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>DRY</strong> (Don’t repeat yourself) aims at reducing the
              repetition of software patterns and code duplications by replacing
              them with abstractions to avoid redundancy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>KISS</strong> (keep it simple. stupid) strives to keep the
              code simple and clean and make it easy to understand. The
              principle suggests keeping the methods small, never more than
              40-50 lines. While each method should only solve one problem. If
              there are a lot of conditions in the method, it should be broken
              down into smaller methods. Thus, they will be easier to read,
              maintain, and potentially debug faster.

          <p>
            Data design patterns are repeatable solutions to common, occurring
            problems in software design. They provide a problem-solving template
            that could be used as a basis for designing a solution. Creating
            data design patterns provides you with techniques, tools, and
            processes that could be used to speed up the development process.
            Patterns can help keep track of the existing types and counts of
            data pipelines as well as simplify the communication between the
            developers by using well-known and understood names.

            Useful insights and analytics rely on efficient data pipelines. The
            ability to scale as the amounts of data sources increase is
            detrimental here. That&#8217;s why it’s a good practice to build
            pipelines that can be easily modified and scaled. This practice is

            for data or “DataOps” and focuses on delivering value faster by
            using automation and sometimes AI to build continuous integration,
            delivery, and deployment in the data pipeline. Embracing DataOps
            will improve the usability and value of data, as well as make it
            more reliable and easier to access.

            To get notified when your data pipeline fails, make sure monitoring
            and alerting are built-in. Focusing on the reliability of your data
            engineering pipeline by regularly checking on error notifications,
            ensures consistency and proactive security. This way the quality of
            data can be easily identified and monitored.

            Follow some general coding principles

          <p>
            Some general best coding practices can also be applied to data
            engineering, such as avoiding hard code or dead code. To be able to
            utilize the code base in different environments in the future, avoid
            hard coding values. Instead, make your pipelines configurable.
            Another good practice is avoiding keeping someone’s abandoned code.
            Removing it will help to keep the code base clean and easy to
            understand for other developers in the future.

            or regulatory issues, data owners or producers need to recognize and
            set data sensitivity and accessibility. It should be clear how the
            data is used, who is using it, as well as where it’s shared. Some of
            the steps for setting the security policy for your data include:
            classifying data sensitivity, developing a data usage policy,
            monitoring access to sensitive data, physical security of data,
            using endpoint security systems for protection, policy
            documentation, employee training, and multi-factor authentication.
