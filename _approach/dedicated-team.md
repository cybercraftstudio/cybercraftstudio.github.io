<h3>Team Extension / Managed Team / Offshore Development Center</h3>

<p>
Software engineering partners can help to augment your staff,
accelerate delivery, or provide expertise in certain technology.
Several different engagement options are available depending on
where you are in your development process.

<h3>Team Extension</h3>

<p>
If a company has teams in place and a software development process
underway, sometimes additional pre-specified roles are needed to
augment your staff. This could be for any of the following reasons:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Need for rapid increase in throughput</li>
<li>
    Need to close important short-term work under demanding deadlines
</li>
<li>Need for lower-cost, high performance specialty roles,</li>
</ul>

<p>
If this is the case, Your Outsourcing Partner provides the
following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
    Identified specialists whose experience, skill and technology
    correspond to industry standards
</li>
<li>Recruiting to fill specified roles</li>
<li>
    On-time, clear and extensive time reporting as proof of work
</li>
<li>
    Internal Management and supervision (SDM â€“ Service Delivery
    Manager) to confirm performance of staff as committed
</li>
<li>
    Commodity services such as office space, internet, IT security
</li>
<li>
    Paperwork &#8212; contracts, payroll, and other legal documents
</li>
</ul>

<p>As such, the assigning company controls the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Product Architecture</li>
<li>Entire SDLC process</li>
<li>Setting requirements, functional and non-functional</li>
<li>
    Tooling and licenses to support development (ex: Jira, Git, Visual
    Studio)
</li>
<li>Quality process (strategy) and approach</li>
<li>Development methodology, ex: agile, waterfall, TDD, BDD</li>
<li>Release process</li>
<li>Results acceptance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Managed Team</h3>

<p>
This option is most relevant when a company has longer-term projects
and wants full-time team involvement.&nbsp; The longer project
duration makes the team more valuable as they gain expertise in your
domain and provide the increased capacity and talent you need.
</p>

<p>
You will have an Agile, cross-functional team of around 7 people,
including front-end and back-end developers, manual and automation
testers supported by DevOps team, and an assigned Scrum Master to
set up the Agile process and provide coaching along the way. All are
100% dedicated to your business.
</p>

<h3>Offshore Development Center</h3>

<p>
Later, we can scale services to three or more Managed Teams using
Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe).&nbsp; All our team members and Scrum
Masters are SAFe certified.
</p>

<p>
This model gives you flexibility if business requirements change,
sudden scaling is needed, or even if the project is put on
hold.&nbsp; As such, this approach is the most effective and
affordable option for most clients.
</p>

<p>
Ownership and responsibilities by customer and outsourcing company
for Managed Teams are allocated similarly to Team Extension, but for
ODC, some of the product architecture, SDLC process, functional and
non-functional requirements, release process and a few others may be
shared for the best outcome.
</p>

<p>
The ODC is a popular business model for different kinds of companies
including startups and enterprise companies. This model has been
used for various business processes and services such as the
creation and maintenance of solutions and software, project
management, testing, migration, and technical or customer support.
