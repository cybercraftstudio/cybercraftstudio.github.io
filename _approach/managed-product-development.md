<p>Managed Product Development is a chosen outsourcing model if the enterprise company has a product idea but lacks either the technology needed or the IT capability for full-cycle software development.&nbsp; In this model, the customer provides the high-level vision for the product, and the outsourcing partner does everything else.</p>

<p>As such, the outsourcing partner is responsible for the entire product development lifecycle, from the initial stages of requirements right on through to Implementation and post-production support and Maintenance.</p>

<p>Among
other skills, a custom software provider engaged in end-to-end product
development, must be able to analyze requirements, design the product
architecture, all with an output-based mentality rooted in Agile. </p>

<p>Some
see this as the most strategic engagement model, one which maximizes the latitude
of the outsourcing partner. &nbsp;This means
that the outsourcing company holds the responsibility of designing and creating
a product for the client. After product release, that company continues product
optimization and sustainability. </p>

<p>Under
this engagement model, the entire product life cycle can be outsourced to a
strategic partner.</p>
